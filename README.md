## Overview

Welcome to the End-To-End Business Intelligence Solution repository! This project is part of the Experis Academy BI Developer Bootcamp and focuses on creating a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solution for analyzing sales data.
The project involves the development of an ETL process, a Data Warehouse, a Power BI data model, and the implementation of reports and dashboards.


## Project Goals:

Data Mart:
Create a Data Mart for the company's sales department, encapsulating summarized data on company sales, along with detailed information on products, product categories, customers, branches, and salespeople.

Dashboard and Reports:
Develop an interactive and informative dashboard with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to empower the sales department with data-driven insights for effective decision-making

## Project Structure:
### ETL Process:

### Data Warehouse:

Description: Holds the schema and scripts for the Data Warehouse. This is where the summarized sales data is organized for efficient querying and reporting.

### Power BI Model, Reports, and Dashboards
#### Technologies: Power BI
#### Directory: reports_dashboards/
Description: Contains the Power BI data model, along with the implementation of reports and dashboards. Visualizations are designed to provide a clear overview of sales performance and key metrics.

##### Sales Dashboard:
The Sales Dashboard provides a visually appealing representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights. It enables quick decision-making and a comprehensive view of sales performance.

##### Salespeople Report:
The Salespeople Report offers detailed metrics and information on individual salespeople. It aids in understanding their contributions to overall sales and identifies areas for improvement.

##### Customer Report:
