# End-To-End Business Intelligence Solution
## Overview

Welcome to the End-To-End Business Intelligence Solution repository! This project is part of the Experis Academy BI Developer Bootcamp and focuses on creating a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) solution for analyzing sales data.
The project involves the development of an ETL process, a Data Warehouse, a Power BI data model and the implementation of reports and dashboards.


## Project Goals:

Data Mart:
Create a Data Mart for the company's sales department, encapsulating summarized data on company sales, along with detailed information on products, product categories, customers, branches, and salespeople.

Dashboard and Reports:
Develop an interactive and informative dashboard with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to empower the sales department with data-driven insights for effective decision-making

## Project Structure:
### ETL Process:
#### Technologies: SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)
#### File name: FinalProject.sln
This file contains scripts and configurations essential for the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. The primary focus is on creating the dimension (dim) and fact tables required for the Data Mart. 
The ETL process extracts data from the operational database, applies necessary transformations based on the Data Mart schema, and finally loads the processed data into the Data Mart.

### Power BI Model, Reports, and Dashboards
#### Technologies: Power BI
#### File name: FinalProject.pbix
The FinalProject.pbix file encapsulates the Power BI data model, reports, and dashboards essential for analyzing sales performance and key metrics. The visualizations within this Power BI project aim to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the company's sales data.

##### Sales Dashboard:
The Sales Dashboard provides a visually appealing representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights. It enables quick decision-making and a comprehensive view of sales performance.

##### Salespeople Report:
The Salespeople Report offers detailed metrics and information on individual salespeople. It aids in understanding their contributions to overall sales and identifies areas for improvement.

##### Customer Report:
The Customer Report displays information and metrics related to customers

### Documentation:
